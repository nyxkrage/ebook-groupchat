      "Joona Linna: The detective explains that he needs to question a fifteen-year-old boy who has witnessed a double murder and been seriously injured himself. During the night he was moved from the neurological unit in Huddinge to the neurosurgical unit at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"What's his condition?\" Erik asks.\n",
      "Joona Linna: The detective rapidly summarizes the patient's status, concluding, \"He hasn't been stabilized. He's in circulatory shock and unconscious.\"\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"Who's the doctor in charge?\" asks Erik.\n",
      "Joona Linna: \"Daniella Richards.\"\n",

      "Erik Maria Bark: \"I didn't mean to wake you,\" he says softly.\n",
      "Simone: \"Who was that?\" she asks.\n",

      "Simone: \"What's it about?\"\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"I have to go to the hospital,\" he replies. \"They need some help with a boy.\"\n",

      "Erik Maria Bark: He notices the stripes on her freckled shoulders from the creased sheets.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"Sleep now, Sixan,\" he whispers, calling her by her nickname.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: Carrying his clothes from the room, Erik dresses quickly in the hall. He catches the flash of a shining blade of steel behind him and turns to see \n",
      "Erik's Son: that his son has hung his ice skates on the handle of the front door so he won't forget them. \n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: Despite his hurry, Erik finds the protectors in the closet and slides them over the sharp blades.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: It's three o'clock in the morning when Erik gets into his car. Snow falls slowly from the black sky. There is not a breath of wind, and the heavy flakes settle sleepily on the empty street. He turns the key in the ignition, and the music pours in like a soft wave: Miles Davis, \"Kind of Blue.\"\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: He drives the short distance through the sleeping city, out of Luntmakargatan, along Sveavägen to Norrtull. He catches a glimpse of the waters of Brunnsviken, a large, dark opening behind the snowfall. He slows as he enters the enormous medical complex, manoeuvring between Astrid Lindgren's understaffed hospital and maternity unit, past the radiology and psychiatry departments, to park in his usual place outside the neurosurgical unit. There are only a few cars in the visitors' car park. The glow of the streetlamps is reflected in the windows of the tall buildings, and blackbirds rustle through the branches of the trees in the darkness. Usually you hear the roar of the motorway from here, Erik thinks, but not at this time of night.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: He inserts his pass card, keys in the six-digit code, enters the lobby, takes the lift to the fifth floor, and walks down the hall. The blue vinyl floors shine like ice, and the corridor smells of antiseptic. Only now does he become aware of his fatigue, following the sudden surge of adrenaline brought on by the call. It had been such a good sleep, he still felt a pleasant aftertaste.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: He thinks over what the detective told him on the telephone: a boy is admitted to the hospital, bleeding from cuts all over his body, sweating; he doesn't want to lie down, is restless and extremely thirsty. An attempt is made to question him, but his condition rapidly deteriorates. His level of consciousness declines while at the same time his heart begins to race, and Daniella Richards, the doctor in charge, makes the correct decision not to let the police speak to the patient.\n",
      "Two Uniformed Cops: Two uniformed cops are standing outside the door of ward N18;\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: Erik senses a certain unease flit across their faces as he approaches. Maybe they're just tired, he thinks, as he stops in front of them and identifies himself. \n",
      "Two Uniformed Cops: They glance at his ID, press a button, and the door swings open with a hum.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: Daniella Richards is making notes on a chart when \n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: Erik walks in. As he greets her, he notices the tense lines around her mouth, the muted stress in her movements.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: \"Have some coffee,\" she says.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"Do we have time?\" asks Erik.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: \"I've got the bleed in the liver under control,\" she replies.\n",
      "The Blond Man: A man of about forty-five, dressed in jeans and a black jacket, is thumping the coffee machine. He has tousled blond hair, and his lips are serious, clamped firmly together. \n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: Erik thinks maybe this is Daniella's husband, Magnus. He has never met him; he has only seen a photograph in her office.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"Is that your husband?\" he asks, waving his hand in the direction of the man.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: \"What?\" She looks both amused and surprised.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"I thought maybe Magnus had come with you.\"\n",
      "Daniella Richards: \"No,\" she says, with a laugh.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"I don't believe you,\" teases Erik, starting to walk toward the man. \"I'm going to ask him.\"\n",
      "Daniella Richards: Daniella's mobile phone rings and, still laughing, she flips it open, saying, \"Stop it, Erik,\" before answering, \"Daniella Richards.\" She listens but hears nothing. \"Hello?\" She waits a few seconds, then shrugs. \"Aloha!\" she says ironically and flips the phone shut.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: Erik has walked over to the blond man. The coffee machine is whirring and hissing. \n",
      "The Blond Man: \"Have some coffee,\" says the man, trying to hand Erik a mug.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"No, thanks.\"\n",
      "The blond man: The man smiles, revealing small dimples in his cheeks, and takes a sip himself. \"Delicious,\" he says, trying once again to force a mug on Erik.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"I don't want any.\"\n",
      "The Blond Man: The man takes another sip, studying Erik. \"Could I borrow your phone?\" he asks suddenly. \"If that's okay. I left mine in the car.\"\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"And now you want to borrow mine?\" Erik asks stiffly.\n",
      "The Blond Man: The blond man nods and looks at him with pale eyes as grey as polished granite.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: \"You can borrow mine again,\" says Daniella, who has come up behind Erik.\n",
      "The Blond Man: He takes the phone, looks at it, then glances up at her. \"I promise you'll get it back,\" he says.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: \"You're the only one who's using it anyway,\" she jokes.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: He laughs and moves away.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"He must be your husband,\" says Erik.\n",
      "Simone: \"Well, a girl can dream,\" she says with a smile, glancing back at the lanky fellow.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: Suddenly she looks very tired. She's been rubbing her eyes; a smudge of silver-grey eyeliner smears her cheek.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"Shall I have a look at the patient?\" asks Erik.\n",
      "Daniella Richards: \"Please.\" She nods.\n",
      "Erik Maria Bark: \"As I'm here anyway,\" he hastens to add.\n",

      "I notice the stripes on her freckled shoulders from the creased sheets. \"Sleep now, Sixan,\" I whisper, calling her by her nickname. Carrying my clothes from the room, I dress quickly in the hall. I catch the flash of a shining blade of steel behind me and turn to see that my son has hung his ice skates on the handle of the front door so he won't forget them. Despite my hurry, I find the protectors in the closet and slide them over the sharp blades. It's three o'clock in the morning when I get into my car. Snow falls slowly from the black sky. There is not a breath of wind, and the heavy flakes settle sleepily on the empty street. I turn the key in the ignition, and the music pours in like a soft wave: Miles Davis, \"Kind of Blue.\" I drive the short distance through the sleeping city, out of Luntmakargatan, along Sveavägen to Norrtull. I catch a glimpse of the waters of Brunnsviken, a large, dark opening behind the snowfall. I slow as I enter the enormous medical complex, manoeuvring between Astrid Lindgren's understaffed hospital and maternity unit, past the radiology and psychiatry departments, to park in my usual place outside the neurosurgical unit. There are only a few cars in the visitors' car park. The glow of the streetlamps is reflected in the windows of the tall buildings, and blackbirds rustle through the branches of the trees in the darkness. Usually, you hear the roar of the motorway from here, I think, but not at this time of night. I insert my pass card and key in the six-digit code, entering the lobby. I take the lift to the fifth floor and walk down the hall. The blue vinyl floors shine like ice, and the corridor smells of antiseptic. Only now do I become aware of my fatigue, following the sudden surge of adrenaline brought on by the call. It had been such a good sleep, I still feel a pleasant aftertaste. I mull over what the detective told me on the phone: a boy has been admitted to the hospital, bleeding from cuts all over his body, sweating; he doesn't want to lie down, is restless and extremely thirsty. They tried to question him, but his condition rapidly deteriorated. His consciousness declined while his heart began to race, and Daniella Richards, the doctor in charge, made the correct decision not to let the police speak to the patient.<|im_end|>\n",
